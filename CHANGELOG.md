# Changelog

## 1.1.1

- Isolated all aionanoleaf2 private `_request` calls into a single `NanoleafApiClient` adapter module — breakage from library updates is now confined to one place
- Replaced per-call `ClientSession` creation with the shared Home Assistant HTTP session (`async_get_clientsession`), reducing connection overhead and latency
- The coordinator and service handler now share a single `NanoleafApiClient` instance per device
- Increased panel light entity device polling interval from 30 seconds to 60 seconds

## 1.1.0

- Added `condition` field default of `true` — animation panels without a condition always animate
- Added optional per-panel `light` entities — each physical panel can be exposed as an individual HA light entity with color and brightness control
- Added options flow to enable panel entities and select the target Nanoleaf device per integration entry
- Added support for multiple Nanoleaf devices — the integration can now be added once per device instead of being limited to a single instance
- Panel entities use `ColorMode.HS` for correct brightness slider behavior (avoids cascading scaling errors)
- Panel entities are scoped to the parent Nanoleaf device in the device registry, giving unique entity IDs per device (e.g. `light.nanoleaf_xyz_panel_1`)
- Panel entities immediately reflect the parent Nanoleaf on/off state via state change tracking
- Turning off all panel entities automatically turns off the parent Nanoleaf entity
- When the parent Nanoleaf turns on, panel entities trigger a fresh device poll to pick up current colors

## 1.0.0

- Added nanoleaf_panels.set_panels service
- Added per-panel solid RGB and HSB control
- Added manual multi-frame animation support
- Added built-in animation presets (breathe, pulse, strobe, cycle, fade)

- Added merge behavior to preserve unspecified panel state
